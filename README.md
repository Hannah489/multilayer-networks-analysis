# multilayer-networks-analysis

Project3 is a network analysis and visualization tool intended for use with both single and multilayer networks.

Still under construction!

## Running Our Program

In order to run Project3, navigate to the ```project3``` directory and run ```npx next dev```. After this, you should be able to view the program by navigating to ```https://localhost:3000/```.

Though still under construction, to run the Flask demo, navigate to the ```flask``` directory and run the command ```python main.py```. Will generate new CSV whenever called.

## Upcoming TODOS:

* Integrate querying support in browser.
* Integrate Flask to generate coordinates for non-geological or non-coordinate based data.
